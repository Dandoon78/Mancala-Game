# Mancala-Game
This game is based off the board game mancala
 This game consists 
 of a two by six grid space with the top row being used by one player and the 
 bottom row being used by the other player. There are four pieces in each of the blocks 
 for both rows. There are also storage blocks on either side of the board which will be 
 used to tally the pieces stored for each player. The goal of the game is to have the 
 most pieces in your storage by the end of the game. 
 The rules of the game is as follows:  
 
        1. Each player takes turns selecting one of the blocks containing stones from their side of the board.
        2. The pieces from this selected block are then distributed one by one to the other blocks in a 
           counter-clockwise direction until the pieces are all out.
        3. If the last piece lands in the storage block then the player gains a free turn.  
        4. If the last piece lands on an empty hole on the current player’s side, then all the pieces in the row, 
           including the the pieces on the opponent’s side, are captured and put into the current player’s 
           storage. 
        5. The game ends when all six holes on either side of the board are empty. If a player still has any 
           pieces left on the board they are then transferred to their storage.
